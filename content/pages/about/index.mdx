Hi!

My name is Micha≈Ç Dobrzycki, and I am a developer focused on the quality and  dev effectiveness (DevFX).

I'm a .NET/Python tutor since 2018. I like new technologies and I'm trying to keep up with current trends.
Currently working on daily basis with Java in [Duco](https://du.co/) as Backend Developer (data pipelines, data engineering, big-ish data stuff).

Hopefully you'll find something here for yourself for free.
If you are interested more in commercial cooperation, don't hesitate to contact me via LinkedIn.
