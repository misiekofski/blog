## My Unique Background

Hi! I'm Michał Dobrzycki, and I bring a rare combination of skills to help companies improve their software development effectiveness.

### What Makes Me Different

**Developer + QA Expert + Business Leader**
- **Technical Depth**: Backend Developer at [Duco](https://du.co/) working with Java, data pipelines, and large-scale systems
- **Quality Focus**: 7+ years specializing in test automation, DevOps, and development efficiency (DevFX)
- **Business Understanding**: 8 years as Project Manager in construction companies before transitioning to IT in 2015
- **Teaching Excellence**: Training teams since 2018 in .NET, Python, and modern development practices

### Why This Combination Matters

Most consultants are either deeply technical OR business-focused. I understand both:
- **The Developer Perspective**: What actually works in real codebases and why developers resist certain practices
- **The Business Impact**: How quality improvements translate to faster delivery, reduced costs, and better outcomes
- **The Teaching Approach**: How to effectively transfer knowledge and create lasting change in teams

### Current Focus

I stay current with industry trends through hands-on work at Duco, where I tackle real-world challenges with:
- Data engineering and pipeline optimization
- Large dataset processing and performance tuning
- Modern Java development practices
- DevOps and automation implementation
