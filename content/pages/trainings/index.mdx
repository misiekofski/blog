The list of my trainings includes (but is not limited to):
- Unit testing
- Api testing
- E2E testing (Cypress, Selenium)
- JavaScript
- .NET trainings
- Java trainings
- Python trainings
- Setting up CI/CD (Jenkins, Azure Devops, Gitlab, Github Actions)

I do not conduct all trainings personally, but I work with specialists in these areas.
Can't find a course you were looking for? I am happy to chat and prepare a training tailored to you.
