I'm working in IT since 2015, before that I used to be a Project Manager in construction companies for around 8 years.

I'm constantly teaching and tutoring entry level people around test automation, Selenium and hacky js stuff in devtools ;)
I also helped corporate clients to set up new processes and provided trainings in test automation, building testing frameworks and teaching QA departments basic coding to help their daily routine tasks.

Because of the current workload I'm not able to provide 1 on 1 trainings, but happy to share my open-source trainings, free learning tools and guides.

I can help you with:
- keeping people up to date with current technologies (especially around QA/DevOps stuff)
- finding areas to develop people skills
- organizing workshops (with strong focus on open-source solutions)
- setting up roadmaps for hard skills trainings (example [here](https://scvconsultants.com/tester-roadmap-2022))
