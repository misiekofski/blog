I have been working in IT since 2015. Prior to that, I spent 8 years as a Project Manager in construction companies. 

I am experienced in teaching and mentoring entry-level individuals in test automation, Selenium, and JavaScript development tools. 
I have also assisted corporate clients in setting up new processes and provided training in test automation, building testing frameworks, and teaching basic coding skills to QA departments to improve their daily tasks. 
Due to my current workload, I am unable to provide one-on-one training, but I am happy to share my open-source training materials, learning tools, and guides. 

I can assist with:
- keeping individuals up-to-date with current technologies, particularly in the areas of QA/DevOps
- identifying areas for skill development
- organizing workshops with a focus on open-source solutions
- creating training roadmaps for hard skills (example [here](https://scvconsultants.com/tester-roadmap-2022))
