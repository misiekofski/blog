# The pressure: ship faster

I’ve heard multiple times (in multiple companies) that we need to ship faster.

It usually comes packaged as:

- improve our **TTM (Time to Market)**
- improve **TTV (Time to Value)**
- and of course… “let’s break silos”

I’m not against any of these goals. They’re valid. The problem is what we often optimize first.

## The default “solution”: write code faster

The typical response is:

- speed up development (as in: how fast developers write code)
- automate tests and make pipelines stable

This is fine. It’s also the easiest thing to measure and the easiest thing to fund.

But it’s rarely the biggest lever.

## A simple math check: where is the time actually spent?

If pure “coding time” is 10% of your end-to-end TTM, then even doubling development speed gives you ~5% improvement overall.

That might be a win.

But is it the win that fixes the real problem? Usually not.

What often happens instead:

- we produce more change faster
- the system becomes harder to understand
- quality starts to slip
- the org burns time on coordination, rework, incidents, and “why did we build this?”

## Speed is nothing without control

The AI era makes this tension sharper.

AI will help generate a lot of code. But generated code can be:

- subtly wrong
- untested
- inconsistent with the architecture
- hard to maintain

So if we want speed, we need *control*. Not control as in bureaucracy — control as in feedback loops, clarity, and quality gates that actually work.

## The real levers live across the whole SDLC

If you want to improve TTM/TTV meaningfully, look at the full SDLC:

- idea → decision
- decision → design
- design → implementation
- implementation → verification
- verification → release
- release → adoption → value

In many teams, the biggest delays are not in writing code.

They’re in:

- unclear priorities
- late feedback
- dependencies between teams
- rework caused by wrong assumptions
- “done” that isn’t actually usable

## What’s important (and harder)

### 1) A good roadmap and a clear vision

Speed without direction is just motion.

If the roadmap changes every week, or if the vision isn’t clear, then faster development just means faster thrashing.

### 2) Everyone understands the business

This is the part we often skip.

If engineers (and product, and QA, and design) don’t understand:

- how the company makes money
- what generates revenue
- what reduces cost or risk

then “ship faster” becomes a generic mantra, not a strategy.

### 3) Align tech with business

Alignment is not a slide deck. It’s a daily habit:

- choosing what *not* to build
- reducing accidental complexity
- making tradeoffs explicit
- paying for quality where it protects revenue

### 4) Make sure it works as expected

Quality isn’t the enemy of speed.

Quality is what prevents speed from turning into rework.

This is where automation matters:

- reliable CI pipelines
- tests that catch meaningful regressions
- fast feedback (locally and in CI)
- stable environments
- good observability in production

## Using AI properly is now part of engineering quality

If AI accelerates code creation, then the bottleneck shifts to:

- review
- verification
- integration
- maintenance

Using AI tools properly means:

- having clear standards (architecture, testing, security)
- reviewing for correctness, not just style
- treating “it compiles” as a starting point
- building guardrails so mistakes are cheap to catch

## Closing thoughts

Yes, we should make development faster.

But if you want better TTM/TTV, focus on the whole system:

- direction (vision + roadmap)
- alignment (business + tech)
- control (quality + feedback loops)

Otherwise you’ll just ship faster… to the wrong place.
