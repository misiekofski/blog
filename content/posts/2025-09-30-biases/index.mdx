After years of referencing Wikipedia's tangled list of 175 cognitive biases, I've distilled them into a clearer framework that's particularly relevant for software teams.

## The Four Core Problems Our Brains Solve

Every cognitive bias exists to help our brains handle these fundamental challenges:

### 1. Information Overload
We filter aggressively because there's too much information. In development, this means we notice:
- Things recently discussed in standups or code reviews
- Unusual bugs or surprising behavior 
- Changes that confirm our existing beliefs about the codebase
- Flaws in others' code more easily than our own

### 2. Lack of Meaning
We fill gaps with assumptions and patterns. In tech, we:
- Find patterns in sparse data (even when they don't exist)
- Fill in missing requirements with stereotypes about users
- Assume familiar technologies are better than unfamiliar ones
- Think we know what teammates are thinking

### 3. Need to Act Fast
We jump to conclusions to avoid paralysis. This leads to:
- Overconfidence in our technical decisions
- Favoring immediate fixes over long-term solutions
- Continuing with sunk-cost projects
- Choosing simple solutions over complex but better ones

### 4. Memory Limitations
We simplify and generalize to remember key points:
- Edit memories of past incidents after the fact
- Form stereotypes about certain technologies or practices
- Remember only peak moments and endings of projects
- Store information differently based on how dramatically it was presented

## The Downside

While these mental shortcuts help us function, they also create problems:
- We miss important information we've filtered out
- We imagine patterns and meanings that aren't really there
- Our quick decisions can be unfair and counter-productive
- Our memories reinforce existing biases

## What This Means for Dev Teams

Understanding these biases helps us:
- Question our assumptions during code reviews
- Seek diverse perspectives in technical decisions
- Build systems that account for human cognitive limitations
- Create processes that slow down critical decisions when needed

The goal isn't to eliminate bias (impossible) but to recognize when our mental shortcuts might be leading us astray—especially during high-stakes technical decisions.

*Cognitive biases are tools. They're useful in the right contexts, harmful in others. Since they're the only tools we've got for processing information, we might as well understand them.*
