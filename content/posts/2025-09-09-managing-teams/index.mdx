# Reviving Burned Out Teams: Setting Technical Goals in Tough Times

Burnout is a real challenge for engineering teams, especially after periods of intense delivery, organizational change, or ongoing stress. As a technical leader, your role is not just to deliver projects, but to help your team recover, refocus, and thrive again.

## Recognizing Burnout

- Chronic fatigue, cynicism, and reduced engagement
- Frequent mistakes or missed deadlines
- Withdrawal from collaboration and learning
- High turnover or absenteeism

If you notice these signs, it's time to act—not just with platitudes, but with real change.

## Step 1: Reset Expectations and Create Safety

- **Acknowledge the situation**: Openly discuss burnout and its impact. Normalize the conversation.
- **Pause non-essential work**: Give space for recovery. Cancel or postpone low-priority tasks.
- **Encourage time off**: Support mental health days and flexible schedules.
- **Listen**: Run anonymous surveys or 1:1s to understand root causes.

## Step 2: Rebuild Trust and Motivation

- **Celebrate small wins**: Recognize effort, not just results.
- **Share stories**: Leaders should share their own struggles and recovery strategies.
- **Foster connection**: Organize informal team check-ins, virtual coffees, or retrospectives focused on well-being.

## Step 3: Set Technical Goals That Heal and Inspire

When the team is ready, shift focus to technical goals that rebuild confidence and energy:

### 1. Choose "Quick Wins" and Low-Risk Improvements
- Refactor a small, annoying part of the codebase
- Automate a repetitive manual task
- Clean up documentation or onboarding guides

### 2. Involve the Team in Goal Setting
- Run a workshop: "What would make our lives easier?"
- Let engineers propose and vote on technical priorities
- Make goals visible and track progress together

### 3. Focus on Learning and Growth
- Schedule short, fun learning sessions (tech talks, demos)
- Encourage pairing and mentoring
- Invest in skill-building, not just delivery

### 4. Communicate Progress and Adjust
- Share updates regularly, celebrate progress
- Be flexible—adjust goals as the team recovers

## Final Thoughts

Burnout recovery is a journey, not a sprint. By resetting expectations, rebuilding trust, and setting technical goals that matter, you help your team move from survival mode to growth. The best technical goals are those that make engineers' lives better, not just the business.

*If your team is struggling, start small, listen deeply, and lead with empathy. The results will follow.*
